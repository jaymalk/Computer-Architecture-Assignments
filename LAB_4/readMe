The submission contains two vhd files:

(1) datatype.vhd- It contains a package(data_type) declaration.
                  This package has datatype of various memory elements.
                  For e.g. Register File's datatype is an array
                  of 16 std_logic_vectors of 32 bits.

                  It also other type decalarations such as what are instruction_class_type
                  and decoded instruction type.

(2) cpu.vhd-  It is the main file.
              It contains concurrent combinational statements
              which decodes the instruction.
              Now after knowing what kind of instruction is to be exceuted,
              a clocked sequential process executes the instruction
              and sets various other parameters accordingly, which
              defines the next state.

Instructions are decoded as per the pdf file "Instruction encoding for Lab4".

Data Memory contents are not to be changed in this assignment
and hence nothing is done with data_in.
